            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Sreenidhi Tadepalli, and I am a second-year student at Northeastern University, majoring
                in Data Science and Mathematics. I have a strong foundation in machine learning, statistical analysis,
                and database management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my journey, I have worked on various data-driven projects, where I have built predictive models,
                developed interactive visualizations, and designed robust MySQL databases. Using tools like Python, SQL,
                and Tableau, I have explored real-world datasets to extract valuable insights, optimize decision-making,
                and improve efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my technical expertise, I enjoy collaborating on interdisciplinary projects that blend data science
                with real-world applications. I am particularly drawn to environmental work, sustainability, and the
                retail/fashion industry, where data analytics can provide innovative solutions to pressing challenges.
                Whether it’s predicting market trends, optimizing supply chains, or analyzing environmental impact, I am
                eager to contribute my skills in a meaningful way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy sewing and dancing. I love creating and
                altering my clothes as it gives me creative freedom in my style and it also acts as a break from my
                day-to-day life. Dancing Is another passion of mine that allows me to express myself in a completely
                different way.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am always looking to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on exciting projects, and
                explore new opportunities in data science. If you’re interested in discussing ideas or working together,
                feel free to reach out!
