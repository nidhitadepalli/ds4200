            <p> Throughout my academic journey as a Data Science and Mathematics major, I have developed a strong foundation in 
                programming, data analysis, and machine learning through a combination of coursework and hands-on projects. 
                My proficiency in Python, SQL, and HTML was cultivated through various classes, where I completed assignments 
                involving data manipulation, querying relational databases, and building basic web applications. Courses in database 
                management introduced me to MySQL and NoSQL, where I learned to design and optimize databases, while extensive work with 
                Excel refined my skills in Pivot Tables and VLOOKUP for data organization and analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my most impactful projects was an inventory management system, where I leveraged SQL and Python to track and optimize 
                stock levels. Using Pandas and NumPy, I cleaned and processed data to identify trends, while Matplotlib and Seaborn helped 
                visualize stock movement and demand patterns. My Custom Property Valuation Tool further strengthened my skills in predictive 
                modeling using k-nearest neighbors. Additionally, as the Chair of the Production Team for the Indian cultural dance team 
                I am a part of, I apply data-driven decision-making to manage logistics and budgets. These experiences have equipped me with 
                strong analytical, problem-solving, and data visualization skills for a career in data analysis.
